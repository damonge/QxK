1. Install CCL https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL

2. Compile the code that computes the 2PCF in the data.
   Typing 'make' should do the trick. The code requires cfitsio and HEALPix.

3. Running './pipeline.sh' will go through all the steps in the pipeline,
   including downloading the data, computing all correlation functions,
   power spectra, theory prediction and doing the fit.
