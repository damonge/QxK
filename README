1. Create a directory "data". Place the DLA catalog (DLA_DR12_v1.dat) there.

2. Install the python module that computes the theoretical 2PCF (cl2wth.c).
   To do that run 'python setup.py install'

3. Compile the code that computes the 2PCF in the data.
   Typing 'make' should do the trick. The code requires cfitsio and HEALPix.

4. Running './pipeline.sh' go through all the steps in the pipeline,
   including downloading the data, computing all correlation functions,
   theory prediction and doing the fit.
