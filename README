1. Create a directory "data". Place the following files there:
   - dat_klm.fits
   - DLA_DR12_v1.dat
   - DR12Q.fits
   - mask.fits
   - nlkk.dat

2. Install the python module that computes the theoretical 2PCF (cl2wth.c).
   To do that run python setup.py install

3. Compile the code that computes the 2PCF in the data.
   Typing 'make' should do the trick. The code requires cfitsio and HEALPix.

4. Running analysis.py will go through all the steps in the pipeline.
   common.py contains a bunch of routines and variable definitions.
